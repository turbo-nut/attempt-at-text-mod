**Did you wish your Risk Of Rain 2 experience was hell?**

Well now your dreams can come true! For Shitty-Text is here to make all the text in the game random rambling and shitty unfunny memes!
It's a delight for everyone!*

*Not for Artificer though.

Installation instructions in ZIP.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
You will have to replace game files, make sure you back up the original ones, but most importantly make sure you know what you are doing,
it could make the text completely unreadable and broken if done wrong (although it really isn't hard to do at all, so don't worry).

NOTE 2: credits and settings are left untouched for obvious reasons, as well as half of the lore because im a bit too lazy lol.

*If any text goes wrong, just verify integrity of game files in Steam, it should automatically replace any modified text file. Enjoy !*
