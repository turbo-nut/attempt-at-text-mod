Reaching in his pocket, Chen pressed the button marked with the Eclipse logo, and many systems began to whirr to life.\n\nHigh up in the atmosphere, a panel on the hull of the UES Safe Travels slid open with a clunk. Ready to be ejected, an Eclipse Zero Vending Machine (c2038) twinkled valiantly. Silently, the vending machine began its journey down to the surface.\n\nBack down on the planet, Chen was starting to run low on ammunition, and the Lemurians were closing in. But, just when the Lemurians were ready to tear Chen apart, who else but the Eclipse Zero Vending Machine came crashing down, squishing the Lemurians into a fine paste. Climbing up a mound of dead Lemurians, Chen entered 5 standard credits into the machine and ordered his favorite beverage, courtesy of the Eclipse Company. \"Wow, refreshing and life-saving! Eclipse, quenching thirsts no matter where you are!\" Chen smiled, grateful for Eclipse's galaxy-wide service and quality assurance.\n\n<style=cMono>This log entry was brought to you by Eclipse: The Galactic ass clapper</style>",

He likes his uncle Rich, isn't that right, Goobo?\"\n\n\"It doesn't have vocal chords, Mike.\"\n\n\"You don't have vocal chords.\"\n\n\"Real mature. Anyway, you better stop messing around, or the Captain will send that slime ball to the front lines. Now, I got to go do my job. Y'know, what we were sent here for, not playing dollhouse with your ‘science project' over here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah... Alright, he's gone. Hey Goobo, listen up. You got a good look at Rich, right?

Then he said slowly, \"No. You are wrong, sir. The Bighorn Bison is not the most dangerous big game.\" He sipped his wine. \"Here in my preserve on this planet,\" he said in the same slow tone, \"I hunt more dangerous game.\"\n\n\"...Sir?\" General Hadbury turned to Rainsford. \"Tell me, Rainsford, what makes game... dangerous?\" Rainsford thought for a moment. \"...The, er, size, sir? Big animals are often pretty tough to take down.\" Habury nodded. \"Indeed, size can be important, but that's not it. In my eye, what makes game dangerous is... intelligence.\" Hadbury met Rainsford's gaze with a twinkle in his eye.\n\n\"The best hunt is always a match of wits. Say I were to lay some traps - how would I go about disguising them so that my prize won't spot them from a mile away? It makes things so much more fun, you see.\" Hadbury turned, walking towards the railing of the balcony overlooking his reserve. \"There's no fun to the hunt, or any game for that matter, if there is no risk involved... if there is no story to the prize. That is why, dear Rainsford, my halls are decorated with the spoils of hunts that could only be described as legendary.\" Hadbury's red-lipped smile grew into a red-lined grin. \"Now get the men ready, for we are going to hunt.\"",
